# C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

`STL` is a **collection of pre-built classes and functions that make it easy to manage data** using common data structures like `vectors`, `stacks`, and `maps`. It **saves time and effort** by **providing ready-to-use, efficient algorithms and containers**.

## Components of STL

The components of STL are the features provided by STL in C++ that can be classified into 3 types:

- `Containers`: Hold and organize the data
- `Algorithms`: Perform actions like sorting or searching on the data
- `Iterators`: Helps go through the data in containers one by one

These components are designed to be **efficient, flexible and reusable**, making them an integral part of modern C++ programming

## Benefits of C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

- Saves time and efort
- Reliable and tested
- Fast and efficient
- Reusability
