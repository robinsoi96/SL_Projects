# C++ Sample Exercise: Pointers with Multi-dimension Array

`pointer_with_arrays.cpp` is the sample source code to demonstrate usage of pointers with multi-dimension arrays as function arguments.

Compile this C++ with g++ as below:
```
g++ -o pointer_with_arrays.exe pointer_with_arrays.cpp
```

Then, run pointer_with_arrays.exe and you will see results as below:

```
2D array output:

Row 1:
1, 2, 3

Row 2:
4, 5, 6

3D array output:

Depth 1:
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9

Depth 2:
10, 11, 12
13, 14, 15
16, 17, 18
```
