# DevOps Engineering

## What is DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices aiming at combining software development (Dev) with IT operations (Ops) practice. 

Some of the key principles of DevOps are:

- `Continuous Integration (CI)` : Very frequent merging of code changes into central repository, followed by automated creation and testing

- `Continuous Delivery (CD)` : Automate the release process so that any changes made in the code are reliably deployed to production at any time

- `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)` : Computing infrastructure can be maanged and provisioned using machine-readable definition files instead of physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools

- `Monitoring and Logging` : Applications and infrastructure are under constant monitoring for their performance and health to identify issues at fast pace

### Benefits of DevOps

- Faster delivery of features and updates
- Improved collaboration and communication between teams
- Enhanced ability to manage unplanned work and changes
- Higher quality software with fewer defects

### Key components and tools in DevOps

- `Version Control Systems (e.g. Git)` : Track changes in source code
- `CI/CD Tools (e.g. Jenkins, CircleCI)` : Automate the build, test and deployment processes
- `Configuration Management Tools (e.g. Ansible, Puppet)` : Automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure
- `Containerization Tools (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes)` : package applications and their dependencies to run consistently across environments
- `Monitoring Tools (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana)` : Track the performance and health of applications and infrastructure

## What is Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
