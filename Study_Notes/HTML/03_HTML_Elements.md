# HTML Elements

HTML element is **everything from the start tag to the end tag**.

Examples of basic HTML element syntax:

```html
    <p>This is my first paragraph</p>
```

From the example above...

| Start Tag | Element Content | End Tag |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| \<p\> | This is my first paragraph | \</p\>|

## HTML Tags

Every HTML tag **should have its own start tag and end tag** respectively as the sample table above.

It is always recommended to have **all HTML tags in lowercase**.

## Empty HTML Elements

**HTML elements with no content** are called empty elements.

For example, `<br>` tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag.
