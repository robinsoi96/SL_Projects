# Docker Installation

You can follow as respective links below to install Docker in your machine:

- Docker Engine (refer to this <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/">link</a>, **applicable only for Linux**)
- Docker Desktop (refer to this <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">link</a>, **applicable for Windows, Mac and Linux**)

<br>

**NOTE:**

- Container shares the same host operating system's kernel.

    - Windows containers run on Windows OS
    - Linux containers run on Linux OS

- You can run Linux container with Docker Desktop on Windows, but what it really does is that it creates a Linux VM for Linux container.
