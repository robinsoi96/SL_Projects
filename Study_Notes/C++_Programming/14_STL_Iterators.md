# Iterators in C++ STL

An iterator is an object **like a pointer that points to an element inside the container**. 

We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container. They can be visualized as something similar to a pointer pointing to some location and we can access the content at that particular location using them.

- They are one of the most important components that **contributes the most in connecting the STL algorithms with the containers**. 

- Iterators are **defined inside the `<iterator>` header file**.
