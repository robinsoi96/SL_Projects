# Verilog Introduction

For a long time, computer programming languages like FORTAN, Pascal and C were used to describe computer programs and their code exuection is sequential.

However, there isn't any language to describe the digital circuits.

This is when `Hardware Description Language (HDL)` came into play. HDLs are even popular for verification purposes.

There are mainly two types of HDL:

- `Verilog HDL`
- `VHDL` (**V**ery High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) **H**ardware **D**escription **L**anguage)

**NOTE:** 

- Verilog HDL and VHDL aren't the same 
- VHDL was used before Verilog came into existance
- This chapter will only talk about `Verilog`

## Verilog

Verilog is a **hardware description language** that is **used to realize the digital circuits through code**.

Verilog HDL is commonly used for design (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-architecture/register-transfer-language-rtl/">`RTL`/`Register Transfer Level`</a>) and verification (Testbench Developement) purposes for both <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/fpga-vs-asic/">`Field programable gate arrays (FPGA)`</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/electronics-engineering/asic-full-form/">`Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)`</a>.
