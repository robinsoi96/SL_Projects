# Node.js Introduction

## What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a free, open-source JavaScript runtime that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and more.

It lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development with JavaScript.

Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications efficiently.

## Download Node.js

Download Node.js from the official Node.js website: <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a>

- Node.js releases a new major version every six months
- For stability, use **LTS(Long Term Support)** version for production projects

Once installation is done, run the below commands:

```
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

If the commands don't work:

- Restart your terminal or command prompt
- Make sure Node.js was added to your system's PATH during installation
- On Windows, you might need to restart your computer
