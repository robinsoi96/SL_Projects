# CMake Introduction

`CMake` is a tool to **manage building of source code**. 

Originally, CMake was designed as a generator for various dialects of `Makefile`. Today, CMake generates modern buildsystems such as `Ninja` as well as project files for IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode.

CMake is **widely used for the C and C++** languages, but it may be used to build source code of other languages too.
