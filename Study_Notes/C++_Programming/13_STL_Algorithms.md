# Algorithm Library in C++ STL

Algorithms are **ready-made functions** that help you perform common operations like **searching, sorting, counting, and comparing on containers** (like arrays, vectors, sets, etc.).

These algorithms are defined in the `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>` header files.

<br>

We can divide the algorithms into following parts:

- `Searching Algorithms`
- `Sorting and Rearranging Algorithms`
- `Manipulation Algorithms`
- `Counting and Comparing Algorithms`
